Sample Java Project With Shell Provisioning
=============================

[German / Deutsch](LIESMICH.md)

This is a sample to show how a shell script can be used to configure a Java environment.

The Vagrantfile can be used to provision the Java application on a
virtual machine managed by VirtualBox. See http://vagrantup.com/
. To see the application running just use:
`vagrant up`. You can find the installation script in `install_webapp.sh`.

The application can be accessed at http://localhost:18080/user-registration-application-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/ .
